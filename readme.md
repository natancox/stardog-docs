Stardog Documentation
=====================

We write Stardog docs in Asciidoc:

* Start a new chapter by copying an existing chapter and tweaking it.
* Pick an Alan Perlis quote carefully! :>

If you're outside our org and are forking this repo to donate improvements to the Stardog docs,
first: thanks!

Second: be aware of the above and make sure to ask questions if you need help.
